UnitFormatters
==============

As of iOS 8, Foundation contains NSFormatter classes for energy, length, and mass--but not temperature or volume.

These classes are designed to be “Foundation-like”, with the hope that Apple will eventually add such formatters to Foundation, and then this code can go away. In the meantime, enjoy.
